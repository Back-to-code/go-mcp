# Go MCP

A go library for easially adding an mcp server to an exsisting server.

This library currently only supports the [Streamable Http](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) standard.

## Public?

DO NOT MAKE THIS REPO PRIVATE!

This library is public so it can be easially imported by other private projects.
Once this library is private it's a fuckload of work to import this package.

Not only do we have go set go variables locally when we want to setup a project that makes use of this library but also in the pipelines and inside the docker containers.

## Usage?
